// https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/

// Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
// two given nodes in the BST.

// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
// “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes
// p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as
// descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

// Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

// Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant
// of itself according to the LCA definition.
