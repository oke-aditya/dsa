// Sort Array by Increasing Frequency
// Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values.
// If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.

// Return the sorted array.

// https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-increasing-frequency/

// Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
// Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
// Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.

// Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
// Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
// Explanation: '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.

// Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
// Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
