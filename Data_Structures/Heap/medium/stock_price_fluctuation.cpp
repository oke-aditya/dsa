// https://leetcode.com/problems/stock-price-fluctuation/description/

// You are given a stream of records about a particular stock. 
// Each record contains a timestamp and the corresponding price of the stock at that timestamp.

// Unfortunately due to the volatile nature of the stock market, the records do not come in order. 
// Even worse, some records may be incorrect. Another record with the same timestamp may appear later 
// in the stream correcting the price of the previous wrong record.
