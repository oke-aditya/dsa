// Find the minimum distance between two numbers

// Given an unsorted array arr[] and two numbers x and y, find the minimum
// distance between x and y in arr[]. The array might also contain duplicates.
// You may assume that both x and y are different and present in arr[].

// Examples:
// Input: arr[] = {1, 2}, x = 1, y = 2
// Output: Minimum distance between 1 and 2 is 1.

// Input: arr[] = {3, 4, 5}, x = 3, y = 5
// Output: Minimum distance between 3 and 5 is 2.

// Input: arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 8, 3}, x = 3, y = 6
// Output: Minimum distance between 3 and 6 is 4.

// Input: arr[] = {2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 3}, x = 3, y = 2
// Output: Minimum distance between 3 and 2 is 1.
