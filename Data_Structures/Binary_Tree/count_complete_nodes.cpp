// https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/

// Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

// According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, 
// is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes 
// in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

// Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

// Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
// Output: 6

// Solution
// Most naive is to do any traversal such as pre / in / post / bfs and increase the count once node is visited.
// Return the count.

// For an approach under O(n). We need optimization.
