// https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-postorder-traversal/

// Given two integer arrays, preorder and postorder where preorder 
// is the preorder traversal of a binary tree of distinct values and postorder 
// is the postorder traversal of the same tree, reconstruct and return the binary tree.
// If there exist multiple answers, you can return any of them.

// Input: preorder = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7], postorder = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
// Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

// Solution: -

// In this case it is not possible to construct a distinct answer always.
