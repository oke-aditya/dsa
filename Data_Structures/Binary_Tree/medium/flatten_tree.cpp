//
// Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
//
// The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the
// right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child
// pointer is always null. The "linked list" should be in the same order as a
// pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

// Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
// Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
