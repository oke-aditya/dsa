// 
// Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
// 
// The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the 
// right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
// The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

// Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
// Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
