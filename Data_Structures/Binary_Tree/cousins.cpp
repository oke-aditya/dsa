// https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree/

// Given the root of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different 
// nodes of the tree x and y, return true if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y in the tree are cousins, or false otherwise.

// Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same 
// depth with different parents.

// Note that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth 0, 
// and children of each depth k node are at the depth k +
