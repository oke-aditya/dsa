Remember structure of graph by adjacency list
is a map<int, vector<int>>

{
    0: [3, 4, 5],
    3: [0],
    4: [0],
    5: [0]
}

This could also be represeneted via vector of vector
here ith index will mark to ith node.

[[3, 5, 5], [], [], [0], [0], [0]]

Note the trick in graph is to construct this and understand the given representation

Keep in mind if graph is given from 0 indexing or 1. 
Accordingly we will need visited vector.

Graph is just a tree, with extra counting for visited.
Keep track correctly.
