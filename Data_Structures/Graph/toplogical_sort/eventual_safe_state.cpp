// finding eventual safe state for the graph

// There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. 
// The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an 
// integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].
// A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node 
// if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).
// Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. 
// The answer should be sorted in ascending order.
