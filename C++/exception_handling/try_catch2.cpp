// C++ library has a standard exception class which is base class for all
// standard exceptions. All objects thrown by components of the standard library
// are derived from this class. Therefore, all standard exceptions can be caught
// by catching this type C++, all exceptions are unchecked. Compiler doesnâ€™t
// check whether an exception is caught or not. For example, in C++, it is not
// necessary to specify all uncaught exceptions in a function declaration.
