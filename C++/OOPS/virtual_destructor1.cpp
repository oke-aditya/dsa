// if a class contains a pure virtual destructor, it must provide a function
// body for the pure virtual destructor. Making base class destructor virtual
// guarantees that the object of derived class is destructed properly, i.e.,
// both base class and derived class destructors are called. For example, a
// class becomes abstract class when it contains a pure virtual destructor.
