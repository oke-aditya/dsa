// Implementing inheritance in C++:
// For creating a sub-class which is inherited from the base class we have to
// follow the below syntax. Syntax: class subclass_name : access_mode
// base_class_name

// Here, subclass_name is the name of the sub class, access_mode is
// the mode in which you want to inherit this sub class for example:
// public, private etc. and base_class_name is the name of the base class from
// which you want to inherit the sub class.

//  A derived class doesnâ€™t inherit access to private data members.
// However, it does inherit a full parent object,
// which contains any private members which that class declares.

// Protected members can be directly accessed.

// Public mode: If we derive a sub class from a
// public base class. Then the public member of the base
// class will become public in the derived class and
// protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.
//
// Protected mode: If we derive a sub class from a Protected
// base class. Then both public member and protected members
// of the base class will become protected in derived class.
//
// Private mode: If we derive a sub class from a Private base
// class. Then both public member and protected members
// of the base class will become Private in derived class.
