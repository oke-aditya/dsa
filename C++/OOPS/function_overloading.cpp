// Function overloading is a feature in C++ where two or more functions can have
// the same name but different parameters. When a function name is overloaded
// with different jobs it is called Function Overloading. In Function
// Overloading “Function” name should be the same and the arguments should be
// different. Function overloading can be considered as an example of
// polymorphism feature in C++.

// If a not exact match is found:–

// ->Char, Unsigned char, and short are promoted to an int.

// ->Float is promoted to double

// If no match found:

// ->C++ tries to find a match through the standard conversion.

// Else:

// Error :(

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

void print_stuff(int i) { cout << "int i = " << i << endl; }

void print_stuff(double i) { cout << "double i = " << i << endl; }

void print_stuff(string i) { cout << "string i = " << i << endl; }

// Functions that cannot be overloaded
// Function declarations that differ only in the return type.
// Member function declarations with the same name and the
// name parameter-type-list cannot be overloaded if any of them is a static
// member function declaration Parameter declarations that differ only in a
// pointer * versus an array [] are equivalent. That is, the array declaration
// is adjusted to become a pointer declaration

// Parameter declarations that differ only in the presence or absence
// of const and/or volatile are equivalent. That is, the const and
// volatile type-specifiers for each parameter type are ignored
// when determining which function is being declared, defined, or called.

  int x = 1;
