// Pure virtual functions.
//
// Sometimes implementation of all
// function cannot be provided in a base class
// because we donâ€™t know the implementation. Such a class is called abstract
// class. For example, let Shape be a base class. We cannot provide
// implementation of function draw() in Shape, but we know every derived class
// must have implementation of draw().

// A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in declaration.

// Virtual functions allow us to create a list of base class pointers and call
// methods of any of the derived classes without even knowing kind of derived
// class object. A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual
// function. A pure virtual function is implemented by classes which are derived
// from a Abstract class We can have pointers and references of abstract class
// type. If we do not override the pure virtual function in derived class, then
// derived class also becomes abstract class. An abstract class can have
// constructors.
