// Friend Class A friend class can access
// private and protected members of other class in which it is
// declared as friend. It is sometimes useful
// to allow a particular class to access private members of other class.
// a friend function can be given a special grant to access private and
// protected members.

// A friend function can be:
// a) A member of another class
// b) A global function

// Following are some important points about friend functions and classes:
// 1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose.
// too many functions or external classes are declared as friends of
// a class with protected or private data, it lessens the value of
// encapsulation of separate classes in object-oriented programming.
// 2) Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B,
// then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
// 3) Friendship is not inherited (See this for more details)
