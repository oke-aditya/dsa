// In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

// Compile time Polymorphism
// Funcion Overloading
// When there are multiple functions with same name 
// but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded

// Operator Overloading.


// Runtime Polymorphism
// Virtual Functions (Function Overriding)
// Function overriding on the other hand occurs
// when a derived class has a definition for one of the member
// functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
