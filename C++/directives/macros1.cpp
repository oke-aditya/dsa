// There are 4 main types of preprocessor directives:  
//     Macros
//     File Inclusion
//     Conditional Compilation
//     Other directives

// Preprocessor programs provide preprocessors directives which tell
// the compiler to preprocess the source code before compiling. All of these
// preprocessor directives begin with a ‘#’ (hash) symbol. The ‘#’ symbol indicates that,
// whatever statement starts with #, is going to the preprocessor program,
// and preprocessor program will execute this statemen

// Let us now learn about each of these directives in detail. 

//     Macros: Macros are a piece of code in a program which
//     is given some name. Whenever this name is
//     encountered by the compiler the compiler
//      replaces the name with the actual piece of code.
//      The ‘#define’ directive is used to define a macro.
