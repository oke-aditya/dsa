// A celebrity is a person who is known to all
// but does not know anyone at a party.
// If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party
// or not. A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party
// such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person
// knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0. Note: Follow 0 based
// indexing.

// Input:
// MATRIX = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
//            {0, 0, 1, 0},
//            {0, 0, 0, 0},
//            {0, 0, 1, 0} }
// Output:id = 2
// Explanation: The person with ID 2 does not
// know anyone but everyone knows him

// Input:
// MATRIX = { {0, 0, 1, 0},
//            {0, 0, 1, 0},
//            {0, 1, 0, 0},
//            {0, 0, 1, 0} }
// Output: No celebrity
// Explanation: There is no celebrity.

// Solution: -
// Naive solution: -
// Traverse through the matrix.
// Find row which is all 0. That is this person knows no-one.
// He must be celebrity.

// Optimized solution: -
// Two pointer approach.
// If a knows b. Then a is not celebrity. B caan be a celebrity.
// Vice versa.
// If b is known a. Then b maybe a celebrity but a is not.
