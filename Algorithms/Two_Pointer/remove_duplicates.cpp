// Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

// Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

// Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
// Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
// Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the
// first five elements of nums being modified
// to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

// Input: nums = [1,1,2]
// Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
// Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first
// two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
// It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
