// Minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train is kept waiting.
// Consider that all the trains arrive on the same day and leave on the same day.
// Arrival and departure time can never be the same for a train but we can have arrival
// time of one train equal to departure time of the other. At any given instance of time,
// same platform can not be used for both departure of a train and arrival of another train. In such cases, we need different platforms,

// Input: N = 6 
// arr[] = {0900, 0940, 0950, 1100, 1500, 1800}
// dep[] = {0910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000}
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 
// Minimum 3 platforms are required to 
// safely arrive and depart all trains.

// Input: N = 3
// arr[] = {0900, 1100, 1235}
// dep[] = {1000, 1200, 1240}
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Only 1 platform is required to 
// safely manage the arrival and departure 
// of all trains.
