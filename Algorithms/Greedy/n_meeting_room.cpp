// There is one meeting room in a firm. There are N meetings in the form of
// (S[i], F[i]) where S[i] is start time of meeting i and F[i] is finish time of
// meeting i. What is the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in
// the meeting room when only one meeting can be held in the meeting room at a
// particular time? Also note start time of one chosen meeting can't be equal to
// the end time of the other chosen meeting.

// N = 6
// S[] = {1,3,0,5,8,5}
// F[] = {2,4,6,7,9,9}

// Output:
// 4
// Explanation:
// Four meetings can be held with
// given start and end timings.

// N = 8
// S[] = {75250, 50074, 43659, 8931, 11273,
// 27545, 50879, 77924}
// F[] = {112960, 114515, 81825, 93424, 54316,
// 35533, 73383, 160252}

// Output:
// 3
// Explanation:
// Only three meetings can be held
// with given start and end timings.

// Solution is very very similar to activity_selection problem.
