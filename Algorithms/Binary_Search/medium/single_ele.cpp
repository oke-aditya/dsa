// https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/

// You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where
// every element appears exactly twice,
// except for one element which appears exactly once.
// Find this single element that appears only once.

// Follow up: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
// Output: 2
