CLassic question is asking the range addition.
Given a set of ranges we need to update a range

https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition/description/

Here we would accumulate the result on left and on right.
Eventually we would just sum up for final answer

A difference array can be used to perform multiple range update where we need to find the answer only after performing all the queries. 
We can do this in O(N) time and space. 
We can update an arbitrary range in O(1). 
It is only when we need to print our final answer that we perform an O(N) computation.
