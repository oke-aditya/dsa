// Problem statement:
// You are given N floor and K eggs.
// You have to minimize the number of times you have to drop the eggs
// to find the critical floor where critical floor means the floor
// beyond which eggs start to break.

// Assumptions of the problem:

//     If egg breaks at ith floor then it also breaks at all greater floors.
//     If egg does not break at ith floor then it does not break at all lower
//     floors. Unbroken egg can be used again.

// Note: You have to find minimum trials required to find the critical floor not
// the critical floor.

// Input:
//     4
//     2

// Output:
// Number of trials when number of eggs is 2 and number of floors is 4: 3

// Input:
// 36
// 2

// Output:
// Number of trials when number of eggs is 2 and number of floors is 36: 8
