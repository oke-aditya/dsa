Start with Knapsack

Understand the subset sum concept

We have 2 state variables here, the sum and number of elements
if sum == 0, we can always make that, making 0 sum means taking 0 elements
if n == 0, we cannot make any sum, unless the sum = 0

so the grid will look

n ->
true, false, false, ....
true,
true,
true,

i row will capture the n,
j col will capture the sum.

Now for i, jth position, we ask the question, is this sum possible for current n.

if the arr[i-1] is > than the sum[j]; then it is not possible, as number is bigger.
if it is not possible, then it is as good as dp[i - 1][j], ignoring the n

otherwise there is chance it is possible

then dp[i][j] is either still not possible, meaning dp[i -1 ][j], ignoring n.
otherwise it is dp sum - current sum.
