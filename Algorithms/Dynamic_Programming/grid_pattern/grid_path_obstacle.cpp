// Unique Path

// A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

// The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. 

// The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

// Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

// An obstacle and space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
