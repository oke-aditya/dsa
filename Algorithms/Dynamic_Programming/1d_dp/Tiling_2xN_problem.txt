Tiling 2xN Problem

We wish to tile a grid of size Nx2 with rectangles (dominoes) of 2x1 (in either orientation).
Write a program that takes input N and outputs the number of different ways to tile the grid. 
Output the ans mod 10^9 + 7

Input

First line contains T (number of test case)
Next T lines contains N(height of grid) 

Output

T lines with desired ans mod 1000000007 in each line

Example

Input:
2
1
2
Output:
1
2

Solution Apporach: -

0. Visualize properly. There are 2 rows and N columns. We need to tile with 2x1. 2 rows and 1 column.
1. We can put it in 2 ways either like

Case 1
| 
|

Case 2
| |     __       
| |     __

Case 3
| | |     | __  __| 
| | |     | __  __|

2. To solve the biggest 2xN tile we need to tile each subtile of 2x2 grid properly.
3. This breaks it to optimal substructure problem. Hence we can use dp here.
4. This takes the fibonacci form = 1, 2, 3, 5, ....
5. We need to find the nth term of fibonacci series.
6. This can be done by normally in O(n). Matrix Exponentiation in O(logn) or use Golden ratio for O(1) answer.
