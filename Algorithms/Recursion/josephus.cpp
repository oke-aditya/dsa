// There are n people standing in a circle (numbered clockwise 1 to n) waiting
// to be executed. The counting begins at point 1 in the circle and proceeds
// around the circle in a fixed direction (clockwise). In each step, a certain
// number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination
// proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the
// executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is
// given freedom.

// Given the total number of persons n and a
// number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth person
// is killed in circle. The task is to choose
// the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so
// survive. Consider if n = 5 and k = 2, then the safe position is 3. Firstly,
// the person at position 2 is killed, then person at position 4 is killed, then
// person at position 1 is killed. Finally, the person at position 5 is killed.
// So the person at position 3

// Solution: -
// After the first person (kth from beginning) is killed, n-1 persons are left.
// So we call josephus(n – 1, k) to get the position with n-1 persons.
// But the position returned by josephus(n – 1, k)
//  will consider the position starting from k%n + 1.
// So, we must make adjustments to the position returned by josephus(n – 1, k).
//   josephus(n, k) = (josephus(n - 1, k) + k-1) % n + 1
//   josephus(1, k) = 1
